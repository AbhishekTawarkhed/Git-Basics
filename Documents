1. Introduction to Git
  
  -Git is a distributed version control system (VCS).

  -It helps track changes in source code, collaborate with others, and maintain history.

  - Key idea: Every developer has a full copy of the repository (not just a snapshot).Git vs GitHub vs GitLab

2. Difference between Git,GitHub and GitLab 

  - Git: A version control system that runs locally on your machine.

  - GitHub: A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. Adds collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and CI/CD.

  - GitLab: Similar to GitHub but also offers built-in DevOps tools like CI/CD pipelines, project management, and self-hosting options.

3. Basic Git Commands

  - git init

  Initializes a new Git repository in a folder.

  ex :
     mkdir myproject
     cd myproject
     git init

  -git clone

  Copies an existing repository (from GitHub/GitLab) to your local machine.

  ex :
      git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

  -git add

      Stages changes (prepares them for commit).

      ex:
        git add file1.txt
        git add .

  -git commit    
    
    Saves staged changes with a message.

    ex:
      git commit -m "Added new feature"

  -git push

    Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

    ex:
      git push origin main

  -git pull

    Fetches and merges changes from remote
    
    ex:
    git pull origin main

4. Branching and Merging

  Creating a branch

  git branch feature-login
  git checkout feature-login

  Or in one step:

  git checkout -b feature-login

5.Merging a branch

  git checkout main
  git merge feature-login
