1. Introduction to Git
  
  -Git is a distributed version control system (VCS).

  -It helps track changes in source code, collaborate with others, and maintain history.

  - Key idea: Every developer has a full copy of the repository (not just a snapshot).Git vs GitHub vs GitLab

2. Difference between Git,GitHub and GitLab 

  - Git: A version control system that runs locally on your machine.

  - GitHub: A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. Adds collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and CI/CD.

  - GitLab: Similar to GitHub but also offers built-in DevOps tools like CI/CD pipelines, project management, and self-hosting options.
